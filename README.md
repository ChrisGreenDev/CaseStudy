# Case Study: Craigslist User Experience and Design Evaluation

  Craigslist is a popular website that allows users to post classified ads. It offers a wide range of categories that are easy to navigate and post/buy. The UI of the website is simplistic and easy to use by design.

**Craigslist caters to a broad range of use cases, including:**

* Buyers and sellers - easy to post an ad or reply to an ad
* Job listings - Finding job listings by category makes for good UX
* Housing both rental and listings
* Community - Forums and sense of community 
* Freelancing and gigs - Finding freelance work is made easier by categories and specific services
* Collectors and hobbyists

**UI Evaluation**

  The overall design of the website is minimalistic both userflow and color. The design choice makes it easy to navigate and there are very few distractions. No matter the page you visit on the website, it is consistent in design which helps the user also navigate due to it being familiar. 

  The website is accessible and responsive allowing all ranges of people to use the services it provides. Having search and filter features on the website also ties into easy navigation and no distractions. Search and filter features are a positive in design of the overall flow of the website and ease of use.

* Typography is "Open Sans" and is easy on the eyes/ easy to read.
* Icons are straight forward and meaningful
* Layout of the webpages are good and are what you would expect from a classified ads website.
* Alphabetical order makes searching the lists easy
* Semi-responsive for all screens (I would like to see a bit more for responsiveness on the main page)

**UX Evaluation**

  The user experience is decent. As mentioned before, the search and filter feature makes for quick and effective searches for the end user. Everything being consistent makes it easy to remember how to navigate throughout all pages. Each page loads quickly and focuses on showing the user only important information. 
  
  The map feature showing ads on the map in specific locations is a great touch that I have not seen on any other classified ads website or service.

* Great filter system
* Different ad views (map, image or detailed etc)
* Consistent content and design makes for easy navigation

**Design Assessment**

  I like the overall design of the webpages. Although they seem dated, the website does exactly what its indended to do with very few distractions. The galleries for each ad work well and are smooth when going from image to image. The choice of color also fits the service well. 
  
  Purple is linked with nostalgia and mystery and when browsing different categories you get the sense of mystery as you find new things and the sense of nostalgia as you find old new things.

* Great use of minimal color
* Image Gallery works well, smooth and clear
* Form layouts are easy to navigate and are alphabetical order
* Search and filter features are easy to find and use
* Creating an ad is easy and informative
* Contacting a seller or listing is easy
* Font is legible
* Font size could be a bit bigger

**Conclusion**

  Craigslist does exactly what its intended to do and it does it very well. Upon entering the site, you are met with imformative information and easy to use functionality. The overall design shouldn't matter to someone who is there to buy or sell so the minimal feel is perfect. Listing or buying is a streamlined process making it easy for anyone to do. 

  Creating an account is quick and simple allowing users to get an ad up quickly. There are a few areas that can use improvements (spam control, communication features and mobile optimization). Overall, for a classified ads website it does a good job allowing users to buy and sell goods/services.
